If you want to build from source, follow these steps:


1.	Download the GNU Classpath corresponding to the ikvm version you have. If you use ikvm from cvs, also use GNU Classpath from cvs or use the latest snapshot.
	The latest (nightly build) version is avaialable at http://builder.classpath.org/dist/ . There is standard version (compatible with JDK 1.4) and a generic version (comptible with JDK 1.5 but has more bugs) 
2.	Download NAnt Version 0.85
	and install it 
3.	Download the Eclipse compiler 3.2
	The compiler is a single file ecj.jar. It is named "JDT Core Batch Compiler". You find it in the download center from eclipse at http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/ . 
4.	Extract the GNU Classpath
	to a directory parallel to the top IKVM project directory. Use the sirectory name "classpath" for the standard edition or "classpath-generics". 
5.	Compile the ecj
	with the command line: ikvmc ecj.jar
	This create a file ecj.exe 
6.	Set the Path to ecj
	The IKVM.GNU.Classpath.dll and IKVM.Runtime.dll must be in the same directory as ecj.exe (or in the GAC).
7.	generics or not
	In the file classpath.build set the property "generics" to true or false 
8.	Run build script
	Change in the directory with the file classpath.build and call NAnt 
9.	Compiler Errors
	It can occur that the list of files has changes then you must modify the file "allsources.lst" or "allsources-generics.lst". After it repeat with the previous step.
