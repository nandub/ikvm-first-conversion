IKVM Build Instructions
-----------------------

This IKVM source bundle requires OpenJDK 6 b16 sources (and build artifacts).

They can be downloaded from the SourceForge IKVM project, or from:

http://www.frijters.net/openjdk6-b16-stripped.zip

This file hould be unzipped in the same directory as where the ikvm directory
(that contains this unzipped source bundle) lives.

Open a Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt (i.e. one that has the Windows and .NET Framework SDK
environment variables set).

Add NAnt 0.85 to the PATH.

From the ikvm directory run "nant clean" and "nant".

You now should have the built binaries in ikvm/bin.


Additional Information
----------------------

IKVM.Runtime.dll and IKVM.OpenJDK.ClassLibrary.dll mutually depend on eachother. This is
accomplished by building IKVM.Runtime.dll in two passes. The first pass defines the methods
and types that IKVM.OpenJDK.ClassLibrary.dll uses, but generally with an empty method body
(look for #if FIRST_PASS in the IKVM.Runtime.dll sources). The second pass is built after
IKVM.OpenJDK.ClassLibrary.dll has been built.

The version numbers of the build is defined in ikvm/CommonAssemblyInfo.cs.

If you want to do a strong named build, make sure you have a key container installed named
"ikvm-key" and run the build with "nant clean" and "nant signed".
