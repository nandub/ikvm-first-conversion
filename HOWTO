Note that IKVM.NET comes with a build script for the GNU Classpath sources as well, you don't need to run the GNU Classpath make files.

If you want to build from source, follow these steps:


1.	Download the GNU Classpath corresponding to the ikvm version you have. If you use ikvm from cvs, also use GNU Classpath from cvs or use the latest snapshot.
	The latest (nightly build) version is available at http://builder.classpath.org/dist/.
2.	Download NAnt Version 0.85
	and install it 
3.	Download the Eclipse Java Compiler 3.2
	The compiler is a single file ecj.jar. It is named "JDT Core Batch Compiler". You find it in the download center from eclipse at http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/.
4.	Extract the GNU Classpath
 archive to a directory parallel to the top IKVM project directory. Use the directory name "classpath".
5.	Compile the ecj with the command line: ikvmc ecj.jar
	This creates a file ecj.exe .
6.	Set the PATH to ecj.exe and make sure that IKVM.GNU.Classpath.dll and IKVM.Runtime.dll are in the same directory as ecj.exe (or in the GAC).
7.	Run build script in the ikvm directory: nant -t:net-1.1
8.	Compiler Errors
	It can occur that the list of files has changes then you must modify the file "allsources.lst". After it repeat with the previous step.
